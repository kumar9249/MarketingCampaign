Problem Statement: A company had previously conducted few
marketing campaigns in order to promote their brand. During
these campaigns, the details and past purchase history of the
customer was recorded. Now, the company wants to use this
data to see how the customers responded to their offer for a
product or service to maximize the profit from the upcoming
campaigns.
Solution: Iâ€™ve performed a quality check on the data looking for
any kind of inconsistencies like Missing or Incorrect values &
Outliers. Then built a Power BI report to analyze various factors
such as Customer Demographics, Product Sales, Campaign
Response and Channel Performance in order to answer different
business-related questions.
